	<p>
		<b>Principal Investigator</b><br>
		jessegomez [at] princeton [dot] edu<br>
		PNI Room 234<br>
		Jesse Gomez is a neuroscientist in the Princeton Neuroscience Institute where he
		is the principal investigator of the Brain Development Lab. He received his BA in
		Neuroscience from Dartmouth College with Dr. Brad Duchaine, his PhD in
		Neuroscience from Stanford University with Dr. Kalanit Grill-Spector, and
		completed postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley with Dr. Kevin Weiner. At Princeton,
		he teaches courses on Developmental and Cognitive Neuroscience.

	</div>
	<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Fred is a PhD student, Presidential Fellow, and Ford Fellow within PNI. He is a 
	member of the Gomez and Wang labs. His research focuses on large scale human brain 
	networks and cerebellar contributions to cortical structure and function across 
	development and the lifespan.

	</div>
	<p>
		<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
		Edan is a PhD student in PNI. She previously worked on EEG analyses in the Dinstein
		Lab at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, and now researches how visual experience
		during either childhood or adulthood shapes the organization and computations 
		that occur within visual cortex.

</div>
<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Omar Singleton is a PhD student in PNI. He previously worked on neuroimaging projects at
	MGH, and now studies how the human thalamus develops across the lifespan and the roles
	it plays in mediating developmental changes in the cortex in neurotypical individuals 
	and those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.

	<img class="patricia" src="/assets/img/patricia.jpg" alt="photo of patricia hoyos" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>
<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Patricia Hoyos is a PhD student in PNI, and member of the Gomez and Kastner labs. She
	is currently studying the development of the human dorsal stream to understand how 
	changes in our attentional abilities and biases are shaped by structural and 
	computational changes occurring within visual cortex.

	<img class="damola" src="/assets/img/damola.jpg" alt="photo of damola ogunlade" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>
<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Damola completed her undergraduate degree in neuroscience  at the University of 
	Pennsylvania. She is a first-year student in PNI rotating in the lab where she'll be
	studying auditory cortex development through novel MRI methods.

</div>
<p>
	<b>Undergraduate Research Assistant</b><br>
	Anna Williams is a research assistant in the lab. Beginning as a summer intern here at
	Princeton, she is currently helping pilot new behavioral experiments designed to test
	visuo-spatial attention development. Using this data, she is designing machine
	learning models for the classification of attentional biases.

	<img class="bing" src="/assets/img/bing.png" alt="photo of bing li" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>
<p>
	<b>Undergraduate Student</b><br> 
	I am an undergraduate senior majoring in neuroscience with a minor in computer 
	science. I am interested in identifying biomarkers that could enhance the diagnosis 
	or treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders using imaging techniques. At the Brain 
	Development Lab, I worked with Fred to investigate the cerebellum-neocortex 
	codevelopment in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. For my ongoing senior 
	thesis, I am continuing the investigation of cerebellar-neocortical pathways, 
	focusing on their potential contribution to object recognition. During my free time, 
	I love coloring, doing yoga, and spending time with friends and family.
