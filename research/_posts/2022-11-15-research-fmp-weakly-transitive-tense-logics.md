# Finite model property in weakly transitive tense logics

## Abstract

The finite model property (FMP) in weakly transitive tense logics is explored. Let S=[wKt4,Kt4] be the interval of tense logics between wKt4 and Kt4. We introduce the modal formula $\mathrm{t}_0^n$ for each $n\geq 1$. Within the class of all weakly transitive frames, $\mathrm{t}_0^n$ defines the class of all frames in which every cluster has at most $n$ irreflexive points. For each $n\geq 1$, we define the interval $\mathbb{S}_n=[\mathsf{wK}_t\mathsf{4T}_0^{n+1}, \mathsf{wK}_t\mathsf{4T}_0^{n}]$ which is a subset of $\mathbb{S}$. There are $2^{\aleph_0}$ logics in $\mathbb{S}_n$ lacking the FMP, and there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ logics in $\mathbb{S}_n$ having the FMP. Then we explore the FMP in finitely alternative tense logics $L_{n,m}=L\oplus \{\mathrm{Alt}_n^F, \mathrm{Alt}_m^P\}$ with $n,m\geq 0$ and $L\in\mbb{S}$. For all $k\geq 0$ and $n,m\geq 1$, we define intervals $\mathbb{F}^k_{n,m}$, $\mathbb{P}^k_{n,m}$ and $\mathbb{S}^k_{n,m}$ of tense logics. The number of logics lacking the FMP in them is either $0$ or $2^{\aleph_0}$, and the number of logics having the FMP in them is either finite or $2^{\aleph_0}$.
